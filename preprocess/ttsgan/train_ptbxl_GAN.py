"""Train TTS-GAN on PTB-XL without modifying the upstream code.

train_GAN.py hardcodes both the dataset (unimib_load_dataset) and the model
dimensions (Generator() / Discriminator() defaults: 3 channels x 150 steps).
Instead of patching that file, this driver rebinds those names inside the
train_GAN module namespace (train_GAN does `from dataLoader import *` and
`from GANModels import *`, so the classes are plain module-level names) and
then calls the untouched train_GAN.main(). The UniMiB path keeps working
exactly as before via plain `python train_GAN.py`.

Run from the tts-gan repo directory (this file and ptbxl_dataLoader.py are
copied there by relocate_scripts/relocate_ttsgan_ptbxl.sh):

    python train_ptbxl_GAN.py --class_name NORM --exp_name ptbxl_NORM ...

CLI arguments are the ordinary cfg.py arguments of train_GAN.py.
--class_name must be one of NORM / MI / STTC / CD / HYP.

Environment overrides:
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_DATA        directory with the ptbxl_*.npy files
                              (default ./ptbxl/)
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_LABEL_MODE  'any' (default) or 'exclusive', see
                              ptbxl_dataLoader.ptbxl_load_dataset
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_NORMALIZE   'per_sample' (default) applies UniMiB-style
                              per-record z-normalization; 'none' keeps the
                              SSSD-ECG global standardization.
                              Keep the default: the generator has no output
                              activation and no final LayerNorm, so nothing
                              bounds its output scale. It was tuned for data
                              with std ~1 (its own output at init has std
                              ~0.47). Feeding the globally standardized PTB-XL
                              (std 0.133) instead starts the generator 3.5x
                              above the data scale and training runs away: a
                              100k-iteration run produced samples with
                              std 8078 vs 0.133 for real data.
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_PATCH_SIZE  discriminator patch size, must divide 1000
                              (default 100 -> 10 patches + cls, the same token
                              count as UniMiB's 150/15. With 25 (40 patches)
                              training collapsed twice: the discriminator head
                              mean-pools the tokens, and averaging 4x more
                              tokens washes out the differences between fakes
                              until D returns a constant 0.5 for all of them
                              and G's gradient dies -- both losses freeze at
                              exactly 0.25 by epoch ~9. At 100, the losses stay
                              live through the same window.)
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_EMBED_DIM   generator embedding width per timestep (default
                              40; must be divisible by 5 because the generator
                              blocks hardcode 5 attention heads). The upstream
                              default of 10 gives each head only 2 dimensions
                              to model a 1000-step 12-lead record; with it,
                              even after the scale and patch fixes, the
                              generator never approaches the data manifold and
                              every full run eventually falls back into the
                              frozen-0.25 state (last one between epoch 19 and
                              122). Checkpoints only load with the embed_dim
                              they were trained with.
    TTS_GAN_PTBXL_WINDOW      timesteps per training item; must divide 1000
                              (default 1000, i.e. whole 10 s records). Setting
                              250 cuts every record into four 2.5 s windows,
                              which shortens the sequence towards the 150 steps
                              the architecture was tuned on and multiplies the
                              training set by four. The comparison protocol has
                              to follow: real data and other models' output must
                              be cropped to the same window length.

    returns the same value for every fake, so G's gradient vanishes. Both

    epochs and never move again, while G drifts until its output is white
    noise at std 22000 (real data: std 1 after normalization).

    Normalizing here puts every generated record on the same scale as the

    an out-of-scale input and keeps producing a usable gradient. The
