# Execution Procedure

## Synthesis Generation
### Step 1: Download Dataset
Since remote server has no outward internet connection, dataset downloads must first be done locally. Dataset downloads will be done manually. 
#### SSSD-ECG
Pre-processed dataset can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/s/43df16e4a50e4dd0a0c5?file=38890965

Expected layout after extraction:
```text
Dataset/
├── data/
│   ├── ptbxl_train_data.npy
│   ├── ptbxl_validation_data.npy
│   └── ptbxl_test_data.npy
└── labels/
    ├── ptbxl_train_labels.npy
    ├── ptbxl_validation_labels.npy
    └── ptbxl_test_labels.npy
```

### Step 2: Download Model
Model downloading also needs to be done locally. To download a model, run
```
./load_model.sh <model>
```
If no arguments are provided, the script will print available models. 

### Step 3: Relocate Dataset for Model Usage
Place the extracted dataset under `Dataset/` at the project root, then run
```
./relocate_scripts/relocate_<model>.sh
```
For TTS-GAN there are two relocate scripts, one per dataset:
- `relocate_ttsgan.sh` — UniMiB motion data (copies `UniMiB-SHAR.zip` into the model dir)
- `relocate_ttsgan_ptbxl.sh` — PTB-XL ECG data (copies the six `ptbxl_*.npy` files into `model/tts-gan/ptbxl/` and the adapter code from `preprocess/ttsgan/` into the model dir; re-run it after editing the adapters)

### Step 4: Sync Local Setup with Remote Server
To sync local setup with remote server, run
```
./sync.sh local-to-remote <destination>
```
`<destination>` is the full path (`userid@remote-server:path_to_dest`) to the target location on the remote server. 

### Step 5: Synthesis Generation on Remote Server
To train the model and generate synthetic data with it, SSH to the remote server and run
```
./job.sh <model> [dataset]
```
Run `job.sh` **directly** — do NOT use `sbatch ./job.sh <model>`. SBATCH `--time` headers are static (parsed before the script runs), so `job.sh` self-submits: it picks a per-model wall-time and submits itself via `sbatch`. Running it under `sbatch` yourself bypasses this and falls back to the static 24h header time.

Per-model wall-time:

| Model    | Dataset | `--time` | Basis |
|----------|---------|----------|-------|
| sssd-ecg | ptbxl   | 24:00:00 | `n_iters=100000` in `config_SSSD_ECG.json` |
| tts-gan  | unimib  | 10:00:00 | |
| tts-gan  | ptbxl   | 03:00:00 | measured 1:53:48 at `TTS_GAN_MAX_ITER=100000` |

**TTS-GAN + PTB-XL timing (measured on nibi, H100 MIG 20GB, batch 16):** ~14.6
it/s, so 100k iterations take under 2 hours wall-clock; the allocated 3h leaves
margin for the per-epoch checkpoint writes and the generation step. This is
faster than the 1000-step sequence length suggests because the generator stays
small even at `embed_dim=40`. The 3h budget assumes `TTS_GAN_MAX_ITER=100000`;
the recommended PTB-XL setting of ~56 epochs (about 30k iterations) finishes in
roughly 35 minutes, so requesting less wall-time explicitly clears the queue faster.

To override the wall-time manually, submit explicitly: `sbatch --time=<HH:MM:SS> job.sh <model>`.

`job.sh` handles job details and computing resource allocation, so double-check before submitting. For SSSD-ECG it runs `./generate_scripts/generate_sssdecg.sh`; for TTS-GAN, `./generate_scripts/generate_ttsgan.sh`. The generated synthesis is stored under `synthesis/<MODEL>/` (TTS-GAN directory naming is described below).

TTS-GAN trains one unconditional model per class; select dataset and class via arguments/environment variables:
```
# UniMiB motion data (default). Classes: Running (default), Jumping, ...
TTS_GAN_CLASS=Jumping ./job.sh tts-gan

# PTB-XL ECG. Classes are the 5 diagnostic superclasses: NORM (default), MI, STTC, CD, HYP
TTS_GAN_CLASS=MI ./job.sh tts-gan ptbxl
```
PTB-XL records are filtered by diagnostic superclass, derived from the 71-dim
multi-hot SCP-statement labels. Environment variables (rationale and evidence
for every default are in *TTS-GAN on PTB-XL* below — **the defaults are the
verified-good configuration; change them only deliberately**):

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `TTS_GAN_MAX_ITER` | 500000 | Training iterations. **For PTB-XL use ~56 epochs' worth** (per-class table below); longer runs collapse. |
| `TTS_GAN_NUM_SAMPLES` | 1000 | Samples generated from the final checkpoint. |
| `TTS_GAN_BATCH_SIZE` | 16 | Lower it only if a job runs out of GPU memory. |
| `TTS_GAN_LR_DECAY` | off | `1` decays both learning rates linearly to zero over the run. |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_LABEL_MODE` | `any` | `any` = record contains the class; `exclusive` = record has only that superclass. |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_NORMALIZE` | `per_sample` | Per-record, per-lead z-normalization. |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_PATCH_SIZE` | window/10 | Discriminator patch size; must divide the window. The default keeps 10 tokens at any window length. |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_EMBED_DIM` | 40 | Generator width per timestep; must be a multiple of 5. |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_WINDOW` | 1000 | Timesteps per training item; must divide 1000. `250` splits each record into four 2.5 s windows. |

Outputs land in `synthesis/TTS-GAN/<date>_i<max_iter>[_w<window>_e<embed>_p<patch>][_lrdecay]/`.
The configuration is part of the directory name because the filenames inside
only distinguish the class: two runs of the same class on the same day with
different settings would otherwise overwrite each other's samples, labels and
checkpoint silently. Runs that differ only in class still share one directory,
so submitting all five classes with the same settings keeps them together.

Outputs per run: `ttsgan_ptbxl_<class>_samples.npy` with shape `(N, 12, 1, 1000)`,
`ttsgan_ptbxl_<class>_labels.npy` with one-hot superclass rows `(N, 5)` in the
order `NORM, MI, STTC, CD, HYP`, plus the checkpoint and a config txt recording
`embed_dim` / `patch_size`. The job log prints `Synthetic sample std` and
`Synthetic diff/signal std ratio`, so a failed run is visible without copying
the npy back.

**Important: cd to the root directory (where `job.sh` is located) before submission so relative paths resolve correctly.**

### Step 6: Acquire Generated Synthesis from Remote Server
To acquire the generated synthetic data from remote server to local, run 
```
./sync.sh remote-to-local <path_to_synthesis_dir>
```
`<path_to_synthesis_dir>` is the full path (`userid@remote-server:path_to_synthesis_dir`) to the `synthesis/` directory
## Synthesis Evaluation - Developing...

# TTS-GAN on PTB-XL

TTS-GAN was published on UniMiB SHAR: 3-axis accelerometer data, 151 timesteps,
9 activity classes. PTB-XL is a harder target for the same architecture —
12 leads, 1000 timesteps, and physiological structure (regular beats, a fixed
linear relationship between leads). Everything below is what that gap cost, and
what is known to work. All adapter code lives in `preprocess/ttsgan/`; upstream
`GANModels.py` and `train_GAN.py` are never edited — the driver rebinds names at
runtime, so the UniMiB path is bit-for-bit unchanged.

## Verified-good configuration

`embed_dim=40`, `patch_size=100`, `per_sample` normalization, and **56 epochs**.
Because a fixed iteration count means different epoch counts per class, set
`TTS_GAN_MAX_ITER` per class:

| Class | Train records | iters/epoch (bs 16) | `TTS_GAN_MAX_ITER` for 56 epochs | Runtime |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NORM | 8564 | 536 | 30016 | ~35 min |
| MI | 4933 | 309 | 17304 | ~20 min |
| STTC | 4727 | 296 | 16576 | ~19 min |
| CD | 4409 | 276 | 15456 | ~18 min |
| HYP | 2392 | 150 | 8400 | ~10 min |

All five classes can be submitted at once; they write distinct filenames into a
shared directory. Throughput is ~14.6 it/s on an H100 MIG 20GB slice.

## Four changes that were needed, and why

Each was isolated by a separate experiment; the first three are defaults now,
the fourth is a constraint on how you run it.

**1. Anchor the generator's output scale** (`ScaleNormalizedGenerator`). The
generator has no bounded output activation and no final LayerNorm, so nothing
holds its output at the data scale. The discriminator's head ends in
`LayerNorm -> Linear`, which is scale-blind: measured on the PTB-XL geometry,
its output moves by 0.004 as the input std goes from 1000 to 10000. Once the
generator drifts out of range, the discriminator saturates, returns a constant
for every fake, and the generator's gradient dies. Unanchored, a 100k run
produced samples with std 22147 against real data at std 1.

**2. Discriminator patch size 25 -> 100.** The head mean-pools its patch tokens
before that LayerNorm. Averaging 40 tokens (patch 25) collapses all fake
embeddings onto nearly the same vector — measured spread 0.102, versus 0.187 at
patch 100 — so the discriminator cannot tell fakes apart. Patch 100 gives 10
tokens plus cls, the same count as UniMiB's 150/15. The cost is coarser time
resolution in the discriminator (1 s per token instead of 0.25 s).

**3. Generator `embed_dim` 10 -> 40.** The blocks hardcode 5 attention heads, so
the upstream default leaves each head 2 dimensions to model a 1000-step 12-lead
record. At 40 (8 dims per head, ~4.1M generator parameters) the run survives
several times longer before degrading.

**4. Cap training at ~56 epochs.** The stability window is measured in epochs,
not iterations. At a fixed 30k iterations NORM (56 epochs) scored 0.941 while
MI (98 epochs) and STTC (102 epochs) degraded to 1.389 and 1.506; equalizing to
56 epochs brought all five to 1.035-1.085. Every 187-epoch run collapsed.

**The failure signature is always identical and easy to spot:** both LSGAN
losses freeze at exactly 0.25 — solving the objectives gives D(real)=1.0 and
D(fake)=0.5, i.e. the discriminator has stopped discriminating — and the output
becomes pointwise white noise. `grep "D loss" logs/job-<id>.out` and look for
dead-flat 0.250/0.250; a healthy run keeps both losses fluctuating in roughly
0.24-0.40.

Linear learning-rate decay (`TTS_GAN_LR_DECAY=1`) helps but does not lift the
ceiling: at 187 epochs it improved the ratio from 1.470 to 1.064, still worse
than a plain 56-epoch run.

## Results

Per-record z-normalized, lead II. `diff/signal` is the std of the first
difference over the std of the signal — pointwise white noise scores ~1.41.
Real and SSSD-ECG are measured on 400 records per class (HYP: 245 for
SSSD-ECG); TTS-GAN on its full 1000 generated samples per class.

| Class | Source | diff/signal | HR-band energy | Autocorr peak |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| NORM | Real | 0.663 | 15.2% | 0.176 |
| | SSSD-ECG | 0.664 | 16.1% | 0.271 |
| | TTS-GAN | 0.939 | 13.7% | 0.089 |
| MI | Real | 0.568 | 26.4% | 0.167 |
| | SSSD-ECG | 0.589 | 27.7% | 0.160 |
| | TTS-GAN | 1.060 | 18.3% | 0.050 |
| STTC | Real | 0.619 | 20.1% | 0.142 |
| | SSSD-ECG | 0.637 | 19.8% | 0.152 |
| | TTS-GAN | 1.085 | 13.5% | 0.063 |
| CD | Real | 0.538 | 28.4% | 0.177 |
| | SSSD-ECG | 0.527 | 29.5% | 0.186 |
| | TTS-GAN | 1.035 | 18.9% | 0.050 |
| HYP | Real | 0.630 | 21.7% | 0.127 |
| | SSSD-ECG | 0.638 | 21.5% | 0.120 |
| | TTS-GAN | 1.057 | 18.7% | 0.053 |

SSSD-ECG tracks the real data to within 0.021 on every class. TTS-GAN is
smoother than white noise and shows isolated spikes, but has not learned
recognizable QRS morphology or a stable rhythm — its autocorrelation peak is
30-40% of the real value.

**Lead consistency** (`|II - (0.5*I + aVF)| / std`, on unnormalized data): real
PTB-XL 0.000000, SSSD-ECG 0.000000, TTS-GAN 0.672. A 12-lead ECG has only 8
independent leads; SSSD-ECG generates 8 and derives the rest by the standard
linear formula, so it satisfies the relation by construction. TTS-GAN generates
all 12 independently and has no such constraint. Note this metric is not
strictly comparable for TTS-GAN, whose output is per-lead normalized by design.

## Known issues

- **Do not compute lead consistency after per-record z-normalization.**
  Normalizing each lead by its own std destroys the linear relation and makes
  real data score ~0.26 instead of 0. Use unnormalized signals for that metric.
- **`diff/signal` is a health check, not a quality score.** Low-pass filtering
  the collapsed output with a width-5 moving average drops it to 0.401 — better
  than real data at 0.657 — without producing anything resembling an ECG. For
  the same reason, do not "fix" the metric by giving the generator's output
  convolution a temporal kernel (it is currently 1x1, i.e. pointwise in time):
  that would buy the number and not the morphology.
- **Absolute amplitude is not preserved.** `per_sample` normalization is
  required for stable training, so compare all sources on per-record
  z-normalized signals.
- **The two models are not solving the same task.** SSSD-ECG is one conditional
  model over the full 71-dim label vector; TTS-GAN is five unconditional models,
  one per superclass, and so uses roughly 5x the training compute in total. Its
  outputs also carry only a one-hot superclass label. State this when comparing.
- **`label_mode=any` means classes overlap.** A record with several superclasses
  appears in several training sets. `exclusive` is cleaner but leaves HYP with
  only 480 records, too few to train on.
- **`--diff_aug` in `generate_ttsgan.sh` is dead.** `cfg.py` defines it but no
  code reads it; it is inherited from the TransGAN codebase.
- **Checkpoints are tied to their `embed_dim`.** Loading one with a different
  value fails loudly, which is intended — but it means old checkpoints cannot be
  reused after changing that setting.

## Two working configurations

The window and capacity ablation produced a second, better configuration. Both
are kept because they are not interchangeable — they generate different signal
lengths.

| | Full-length | Short-window |
|---|---|---|
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_WINDOW` | 1000 (default) | 250 |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_EMBED_DIM` | 40 (default) | 80 |
| `TTS_GAN_PTBXL_PATCH_SIZE` | 100 (auto) | 25 (auto) |
| Training length | 56 epochs per class | ~8000 gradient steps per class |
| Output shape | `(N, 12, 1, 1000)` | `(N, 12, 1, 250)` |
| Use it for | direct comparison against SSSD-ECG, which emits 10 s records | best available TTS-GAN morphology, if the comparison set is cropped to 2.5 s |

`diff/signal` gap against a real-data baseline computed at the same window
length (a 2.5 s crop of real PTB-XL scores 0.571-0.700, not 0.66):

| Class | Full-length gap | Short-window gap |
|---|---|---|
| NORM | +0.276 | **+0.209** |
| MI | +0.492 | **+0.362** |
| STTC | +0.466 | **+0.299** |
| CD | +0.497 | **+0.449** |
| HYP | +0.427 | **+0.312** |

The short-window configuration closes roughly a quarter of the gap and is the
first setting whose output shows sharp isolated spikes on a comparatively flat
baseline. It is still clearly distinguishable from real ECG.

## What the ablation showed about stability

Collapse point by configuration, measured from the loss trace (both LSGAN
losses frozen at 0.25):

| Configuration | Collapse at |
|---|---|
| window 1000, embed 40 | > 30,000 steps (56 epochs) |
| window 1000, embed 80 | ~14,500 steps (~27 epochs) |
| window 250, embed 80 | ~8,500 steps (~4 epochs) |

Both shortening the window and widening the generator **shorten** the stability
window in gradient steps, so each configuration has to be stopped at its own
point rather than trained to a common budget. Which quantity drives the
collapse also changes with the window: at 1000 steps per record, equalizing
epochs across classes fixed it, while at 250 steps HYP ran 13.4 epochs without
collapsing and matching gradient steps was the right protocol instead.

A training-length sweep at window 250 / embed 80 (4k, 6k, 8k, 12k, 16k steps)
put the quality peak at 8000, just before the collapse — and `diff/signal`
ranked 6000 higher, another reason not to trust it for ranking.

## Recommended next steps

1. **Build `evaluation/`.** `diff/signal` was built to detect training failure
   quickly and repeatedly proved unreliable as a quality score: it ranked a
   low-pass-filtered collapse above real data, and it ranked a 6000-step run
   above the 8000-step run that is visibly better. Every quality judgement in
   this work ended up being made from waveform plots. A benchmark needs
   morphology, power spectra, distributional distance, and a train-on-synthetic
   / test-on-real classifier score.
2. **Extend the stability window before spending capacity on it.** Every failure
   so far is the discriminator winning outright, and the two cheapest untried
   remedies target that directly: the discriminator learns 3x faster than the
   generator by default (`TTS_GAN_D_LR` 3e-4 against `TTS_GAN_G_LR` 1e-4), and
   `TTS_GAN_LOSS=wgangp` selects an objective that upstream already implements
   and that is far less prone to this particular vanishing-gradient collapse.
   Note that `--d_spectral_norm`, the other standard stabiliser, is defined in
   `cfg.py` but read nowhere in the training code -- using it means writing it.
3. **Then raise model capacity.** `latent_dim` (100) and the generator's `depth`
   (3) are both untried, and neither needs a change to the model code -- only
   the same runtime rebinding `embed_dim` already uses. Do this after step 2,
   not before: the one capacity change already measured, `embed_dim` 40 -> 80,
   improved quality slightly but cut the stability window from >30k gradient
   steps to ~14,500, so extra capacity is currently paid for in training length.
   `latent_dim` additionally appears hardcoded as 100 in the generation step of
   `generate_ttsgan.sh` and in upstream's `gen_plot`, so both need updating with
   it or generation will fail on a shape mismatch.
4. **Reduce the difficulty of the task itself.** Windows are currently cut at
   arbitrary offsets, so the generator has to learn where beats fall as well as
   what they look like; centring each window on a detected beat removes half of
   that. Generating 8 leads and deriving the other 4 by the standard formula --
   as SSSD-ECG does -- would also stop the model spending capacity on 4 leads
   that are not independent, and would make its output physiologically
   consistent by construction.
